# DeckDeckGo - Highlight Code

A Web Component to highlight your code.

It is developed with [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com) and use [Prism.js](https://prismjs.com) from [Lea Verou](http://lea.verou.me) and [James DiGioia](https://twitter.com/jamesdigioia) for the highlighting itself.

Furthermore, the inspiration for the design of the cards comes from the amazing [carbon](https://carbon.now.sh), a tool to create and share beautiful images of your source code.

This component was originally developed for the deprecated project [DeckDeckGo](https://deckdeckgo.com).
